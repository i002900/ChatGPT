# ChatGPT
An illustration of the use of the chatGPT API
This project illustrates a simple deployment of the GPT-5 openAI LLM.
A client proxy is created by passing the API_KEY.
The chat.completions.create API is invoked and a task is passed to the LLM model.

The following lines were passed to the model:
 'How quietly does the orange branch, observe the sky begin to blanch.
  Without a sigh, without a prayer, with no betrayal of despair'.

  The model was prompted to complete the poem using the chat completions API.

  We got the followig output:

  "Embracing change with gentle grace, the branch awaits the dawn's embrace. 
   Its leaves now tinged with golden light, a symbol of the coming night.
   And as the stars begin to dance, the branch remains in silent trance. A witness to the world's advance, in nature's timeless, endless expanse."
